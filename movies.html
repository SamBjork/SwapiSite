                                <p>The prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, were all directed by George Lucas and received a more mixed reaction from critics and fans in comparison to the original trilogy. All six films were nominated for or won Academy Awards, and were commercial successes, with a combined box office revenue of $4.38 billion, making Star Wars the fourth highest-grossing film series and creator George Lucas a very wealthy man.</p>
